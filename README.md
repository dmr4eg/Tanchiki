### **Project "Tanchiki"**<span dir="">:video_game:</span>

> **"Tanks" is a retro game that was developed and released in the 1980s. The game was originally created for the Atari 2600 console, but it was later ported to other systems, including the Commodore 64, Apple II, and others.**

#### Our remake will contain the same idea like in original game. We share interests with retro games, and from our opinion it is quite interesting project to re-create. Now, let's see what our project will be in the future:

#### The game involves two players that engage in a real-time battle to the death against bots. Also it can be played in a solo mode (versus the same enemies - bots). Game goal is to kill all enemies, stay alive and defend base, while they're trying to destroy players base and kill everyone. Players must be careful, because team damaging is allowed.

#### The game is played from a top-down perspective, and players control their tanks as they try to destroy their opponent. The game will be using only keyboard movement for both players. Read info about controls, software documentation, game models and more on other pages.
